Fly in survival without damaging players!

## UPDATED

We have added support for more APIS. Check plugin.yml for more infomation.

* Added API Support for: 3.0.0-ALPHA5, 3.0.0-ALPHA6, 3.0.0 (All versions of 3.0.0 ALPHAs) and 3.0.1.

* Fixed the /fly mid air glitch. (Test it yourself. I'll be sure to add a download link once tested.)

## How to test it?

* Download it via zip file. By clicking Clone and download.

* Then click Download zip.

* Once done, go to http://pmt.mcpe.fun

* Then click Complie phar.

* Then insert your zip file. This should then make a .phar file if no errors occur. If however they do occur, we will try fixing it ASAP.
